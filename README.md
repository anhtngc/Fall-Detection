# Fall Detection Using YOLOv9 on Raspberry Pi 5
## 1️⃣ Overview:
This project aims to develop a real-time fall detection system using a deep learning model. It is *based on a previously published study that achieved an mAP@0.5 of 98.1% using the YOLOv9 model*. However, we have re-trained and fine-tuned the model by adjusting parameters and using an updated dataset, achieving an improved final training **accuracy of 99%**.

Following this, the system is developed on an embedded platform using the Raspberry Pi 5 combined with a USB Webcam to ensure flexibility, low cost, and ease of practical deployment. When a fall is detected, the system instantly sends alerts to users through messaging platforms, significantly reducing response time and enabling timely assistance in emergency situations.

This solution is designed for deployment in various environments such as homes with elderly or children, unsupervised areas, construction sites, and hazardous zones, aiming to enhance safety and minimize risks caused by falls.

### Key Features:
- YOLOv9-based deep learning model for fall detection
- Fine-tuned and optimized model for higher training accuracy
- Raspberry Pi 5 embedded deployment with USB Webcam
- Real-time processing and alerting
- Low latency for fast response
Suitable for elderly, children, construction, hazardous zones.
